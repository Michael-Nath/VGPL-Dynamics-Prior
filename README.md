# VGPL-Dynamics-Prior

PyTorch implementation for the dynamics prior (i.e., dynamics module) of the Visually Grounded Physics Learner (VGPL).

### Evaluate the trained model on the demo validation data

Go to the project folder, and type one of the following three commands (assuming you have all the dependencies installed):

    bash scripts/dynamics/eval_RigidFall_dy.sh
    bash scripts/dynamics/eval_MassRope_dy.sh
    bash scripts/dynamics/eval_FluidIceShake_dy.sh
